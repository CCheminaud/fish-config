# [Fish](https://fishshell.com) shell configuration

My fish shell configuration and functions.

## Getting started

### MacOS

First, clone the config in the right place.

```shell
mv ~/.config/fish /tmp/
git clone https://github.com/CCheminaud/fish-config.git ~/.config/fish
```

Then, install fish with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/index).

```shell
brew install fish
```
