# [Fish](https://fishshell.com) shell configuration

My fish shell configuration and functions.

## Getting started

Be sure fish shell is already installed with [fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher).

First, just clone the config at the right place.

```shell
mv ~/.config/fish /tmp/
git clone https://github.com/CCheminaud/fish-config.git ~/.config/fish
```

Then, install all fisher plugins.

```shell
fisher update
```
